                    For example, in the merchant account compensation plan depicted below, a business owner could currently be paying around $600 a month in total fees for all transactions purchased
                    with a credit or debit card. TMS allows the merchant to get a rebate on a portion of the fees he would already be paying all while helping other TMS members.
                </h1>
                <h1>
                	The 7LPB pay structure is also applied to other rebates TMS has negotiated with companies. That means that you'll be getting rebates for services you're probably already paying for; electricity, cell phone, etc.
